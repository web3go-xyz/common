# Why Web3Go DIN

Blockchain technology has brought about a new era of decentralized data management, but it has also presented some challenges that need to be addressed.  These include difficulties in accessing and understanding data, verifying its authenticity, and rewarding contributors for their work. In this article, we'll examine these challenges in detail and showcase why Web3go DIN is the ideal network to overcome them.&#x20;

## Challenge 1: Accessing and understanding blockchain data

For most individuals, accessing and interpreting blockchain data can be a daunting task. While there are several blockchain analysis tools available, comprehending the data still demands specialized knowledge and skills, such as data indexing, smart contract expertise, SQL proficiency and business intelligence skills.

Even after accessing and visualizing data, understanding blockchain data requires interpreting it from a business logic perspective. Furthermore, given the constantly updating nature of blockchain data, capturing and analyzing all the information in real-time can be challenging for anyone.



## Challenge 2: Verifying the Authenticity of Blockchain Data

With the increasing amount of data being generated in the crypto industry every day, including on-chain and off-chain data, it's becoming more challenging to differentiate between accurate and fraudulent information. Verifying on-chain data requires significant effort, while off-chain data, such as social media and news, cannot be directly authenticated, making it difficult for users to collect and filter relevant information.



## Challenge 3:  Rewarding Data Contributors Fairly

In the blockchain industry, data analysts often do not receive adequate compensation for their work, as the platforms hosting their analyses profit from them instead.

On the other hand, there are many individuals who possess deep knowledge in data industry but lack specialized blockchain analysis skills. These individuals, whom we refer to as "data specialists," have the potential to contribute valuable insights to the blockchain industry.&#x20;

However, to fully leverage their expertise, a platform is needed to process and showcase their contributions in a more accessible and intuitive format. Additionally, it's crucial to measure the work of these contributors accurately to ensure they receive fair compensation for their valuable contributions.
