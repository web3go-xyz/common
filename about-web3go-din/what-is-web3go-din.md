# What is Web3Go DIN

Web3Go DIN (Data Intelligence Network) is a new-generation data infrastructure to connect human, data, and AI. DIN prioritizes people, with AI support and blockchain-based proof of equity at its core. With community contribution, Web3Go DIN can learn as community drives.

**Human:** The relationship between human beings and data is symbiotic. At the beginning of the Data Intelligence Network are people, as human activities are the primary source of data. These activities generate raw data not only on-chain but also off-chain. In turn, all business decisions rely on data, whether objective data on the blockchain or subjective data off the chain. Therefore, the flow of data and human activities are mutually dependent.

**Data:** On a daily basis, humans generate copious amounts of on-chain and off-chain data, serving as the primary source of raw data for the Data Intelligence Network (DIN). Through DIN's rigorous data processing procedures, real-time on-chain data, and high-quality annotated data from domain experts are transformed into clean training data for the Web3go neural network. As the network ingests more high-quality data, it grows in power and sophistication, enabling advanced data analysis and comprehension. This sophisticated neural network, in turn, enhances the human capacity for data analysis and comprehension.

**AI:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally a neural network comprising billions of nodes that necessitate three essential factors for iteration: algorithms, computing power, and data. The optimization of these core factors demands human labor, as high-quality data fed into the Web3go neural network leads to continuous improvements in our AI technology, ultimately enhancing human productivity to a significant degree.

In conclusion, the interdependence between humans, data, and AI underscores the critical role of human labor in optimizing data processing and AI technology. By continuously improving Web3go's neural network with high-quality data, we can enhance human productivity and advance the potential of AI. The symbiotic relationship between humans and technology, therefore, remains a critical aspect of DIN's mission to revolutionize data analysis and comprehension.
