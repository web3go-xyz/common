Once you have approved the transaction, you will own your DIN Passport and be ready to begin using DIN.  DIN is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain, so you only need to pay a small gas fee. With your DIN Passport, you will be able to collect and manage gold leaves, and participate in other activites at DIN.
